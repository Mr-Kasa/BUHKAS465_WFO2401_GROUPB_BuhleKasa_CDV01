### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - I am proficient in HTML, CSS/Tailwind and a little bit of JavaScript.
    - The skill I need to improve is JavaScript. Then learn frameworks like REACT.
2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - My key areas of interest are web development and also mobile app development using REACT native.
    - The most important values are Functional and efficient software projects delivered on time. 

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - Junior Front-end development, junior back-end development, freelance development, and mobile application development using REACT native are the basic career options for me when I
      start out.
    - REACT native development is a recent interest of mine. I intend to be able to create e-commerce websites, then create chrome extensions and mobile applications related to it.
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - All the intended roles are inline with my current education and skills. In order to be able to create proffesional 
      websites I have to be able to understand HTML, CSS and 
      Javascript. But i will also need to learn Frameworks like REACT. To be able to create mobile applications I will 
      need to learn REACT native. So i am on a straight path towards 
      making my dream of being web and mobile application developer true. It will be easier to understand REACT native   
      after understanding REACT. 
    - I need to make sure i understand Javascript Language deeply in order to be able to create functioning websites. It 
      will be greatly important for me to be able to have a deep understanding of API's. API intergrations are a crucial 
      element in e-commerce.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - SMART goal and thinking behind it.

    SPECIFIC:      I will learn and understand Javascript, REACT and REACT native before the end of the the year. I will 
                   develop fully functioning e-commerce websites and their mobile applications before the end of next 
                   year.

    MEASURABLE:    The Codespace curriculum will give me a deep understanding of front and back end javascript as well as 
                   equipping me with fundemental understanding of REACT. that means in 4 months time I will be ready      
                   to start learning REACT native as I continue to gain deeper understanding of REACT.

    Achievable:    I have been doing quite well on my academics so far and i intend to do even better with JavaScrip    
                   language module.

    Relevant:      I want to be well equipped to get freelance jobs immediatly when I graduate from Codespace Academy and 
                   to be wanted by employers everywhere. Most importantly I will be able to go into tech entrepreneurship 
                   if i so choose.

    Time-bound:    I am already 20%-30% into my journey and i intend to be fully eqquiped with the skills i want by the 
                   end of 2024.

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Artificial intelligence has always been my long term goal. so after being with the above mentioned skills i intend 
      to learn either a C language or python in order to start my journey in AI development.
    - My current skills are a foundation that will give me a baseline of what software development and writing code is. 
      once i fully master the languages i am learning now, I will be able to use them to finance my future in AI.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - To have a fundemental understanding of javascript i will make sure i excel in the Codespace curriculum. Then i will 
      work on projects that are similar to what employers might want. then from there I will use platforms like 
      freeCodeCamp to learn react Native.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - To prepare for my long term goals i will have to have deep understanding of software development, specifically 
      javaScript. this will give me a baseline on which i can use to learn other languages easier and quicker. Then i 
      will have to push myself to learn REACT native.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - The only obstacle i might have is that potential employers might not recognize my skills in REACT native once i 
      learn it because it will not have been part of the Codespace curriculum.
    - I will create a lot of portfolio projects using REACT native in order to show my skills in it.
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - I will make the best use of Codespace resources while i can, I will also make sure i use others like freecodecamp, 
      stackoverflow and so many more. I also follow social media groups where we show case our work anonymously if so 
      required and ask to be rated by other developers or ask for solutions to problems that i cant solve.

### Conclusion and Next Steps

- I know that this year i have to master Javascript and its frameworks completely.It is important that i master it now so 
  that everything that comes after is easier to understand.
- The next immediate step is to make sure i maintain a high everage on my grades.
